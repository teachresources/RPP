# What You Should Learn

Building software is complex. It's way harder than "programming" alone. From creating usuable and accessible interfaces to ensuring data security, a developer has to balance many decisions that have real impact. 

![Software development process](sdp.jpg)

In this course you will be learning the tools and techniques used by professional software developers. In fact you will be working on **real software projects** for **real clients** the same way you would as a **professional software developer**. 

Throughout this course you will work on several short and long term software projects. These projects are meant to hone the discipline and logical thinking skills necessary to craft error-free syntax for the writing and testing of programs.

You will need to make critical desicions along the way that could have a major impact on the final success of the project. In so doing, you will develop key skills of discernment and judgment as you must choose from language frameworks, development environments, and strategies for the program life cycle.

# Why It Matters

You may or may not have interest in software development as a career, but the skills you earn in this class will benefit you in a wide variety of careers. 

### Collaboration

In the real-world you have to work with other people. And no one cares if you don't like it. Working together is a combination of following the norms and communicating. It doesn't mean you have to like everyone or be liked by everyone. 

**You will learn to strategies to work together, include others' ideas, and communicated effectively with your team.**

### Organization

Syntax is the easy part. Learning to create complex software is all about organization. There are many different ways to plan and organize a software project, and you will get familiar with several during this course. 

**You will learn strategies and tools to help you plan, develop, and maintain a complex software project with a team.**

### Decision Making

Writing code for a pre-defined problem (e.g. todo list app) doesn't require you to make many decisions. We will be working on unique pieces of software however, that are not pre-defined. Defining a project requires you to make decisions about technology, organization, and much more.

**You will learn to make informed descions about software projects.**

### Patience and Resilience

There will be many points during the semester that you will hit a wall. That is because the problems we are solving are real and often do not have obvious solutions. A key skill of every successful person I know is patience and resilience. Patience is the ability to delay gratification - to understand that we don't always get a reward for every success. Resilience is the ability to pick yourself up when you fail. 

**You will hone your patience and resilience this semester working on a variety of projects.**

# What You Get To Create

We will begin the semester by developing a personal blog to showcase your learning and projects during the semester.

The majority of the semester you will work with a team on a client project. Our current clients are:
- **D-B Athletics**   
  The Atheltics office needs a new season ticket sales application to track season ticket holders.
- **Exchange Place**   
  The Exchange place has commissioned a website to engage potential visitors and share historical information.

You will also create a [Capstone Project](/capstone) which is a sememster-long project that requires you to utilize the skills and knowledge gained from the course. Presenting this project will be your final exam.

# Course Goals

- **Software Development Environments:** Select and utilize technologies like IDEs, libraries, source control tools, and APIs, and use them in the development of a variety of software applications.
- **Ethics/Legal:** Make informed judgments in software design and development based on legal and ethical principles.
- **SDLC:** For a software application utilize the Software Development Life Cycle along with modern design/development tools to:
  - **Requirements:** Gather and write software requirements.
  - **Design:** Design an effective and appealing user interface.
  - **Development:** Write clean, well-documented code.
  - **Testing/Quality Assurance:** Write unit and integration tests.
  - **Deployment:** Deploy software.
  - **Review:** Write and utilize code reviews.
- **Collaboration:** Work effectively as part of a team. Make significant contributions to the team’s work.

# Grading

## Personal Contribution

Your grade will be based on your personal contributions. I will determine you personal contributions by looking at your:

- Team member evaluation (Once every 4.5 weeks)
- Personal developer blog (New post each week)
- Personal git log
- Participation in our group meetings/discussions

<div class="callout callout--danger">
    <p><strong>Personal Contributions > Team Contributions</strong></p>
    <p>All team members are expected to make significant contributions to their team. <b>Team members that do very little work will fail team assignments.</b> In other words, it is possible for you to fail an assignment even when the your team project is excellent.</p>
</div>

## Standards Based Grading

You will be graded on a four-point, standards-based scale. Each week you will receive a score based on the course objectives above that were worked on during that time. 

| Level                       | Description                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Level 4**<br>Exemplary    | You have gone above and beyond the objectives for the week. There are no obvious errors. It is evident that you've mastered the concepts and skills. |
| **Level 3**<br>Accomplished | You have accomplished the objectives for the week. There are few errors. It is evident that you understand the concepts and can use the skills.      |
| **Level 2**<br>Developing   | You have started to understand the concepts and can use the majority of the skills. Errors and mistakes are common.                                  |
| **Level 1**<br>Not Yet      | You have made an effort to understand the concepts or use the skills, but you have not got it yet. Too many errors and mistakes.                     |
| **Zero**                    | No attempt or effort made.                                                                                                                           |

## Grade Conversion

In order to convert your standard-based scores to traditional grades the following algorithm will be used.

| Criteria                                                                         | Converted Grade |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------: |
| Level 3 and 4 in each of the standards for that week.                            |        A        |
| Level 2 in any standard with remaining standards in Level 3 and 4 for that week. |        B        |
| Level 2 in more than one standard and no Level 1 for that week.                  |        C        |
| Level 2 in two-thirds of standards or Level 1 in a standard for that week.       |        D        |
| Level 1 in more than one standard or  Level 0 any standard for that week.        |        F        |

## GitHub
The coding program has its own GitHub Organization at `db-cs` and all exercises this semester will be under `db-cs-spring-2020`. The majority of our group work will take place on one of these organizations. Any work completed for the class must be done on GitHub. If it is not in a repo on GitHub, it does not exist.

### GitHub Username

Use the form below to submit your GitHub username, so I can add you to the organizations and teams. Don't have one? Go to [github.com/join](https://github.com/join) and register using a non-school email address.

<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdDZQ_TJpiytfzpepFG8ZKVb-gavO-5otoZ9S9bSKw-EbiVRg/viewform?embedded=true" style="max-width: 640px;" width="100%" height="660" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">Loading…</iframe>

### GitHub Teams
You will also be on a GitHub Team called [Coding 2](https://github.com/orgs/db-cs-spring-2020/teams/coding-2/discussions). We will use the team discussions to make announcements and communicate about projects. Within the parent team we will also have sub-teams that will collaborate on current projects.

<a href="https://github.com/orgs/db-cs-spring-2020/teams/coding-2" class="btn btn--dark btn--rounded btn--w-icon"><i class="icon icon--github"></i>Coding 2 Team</a>

### Submissions

Sometimes you will be asked to create repositories on your own account. Other times you will need to work on the organization account. In either case, instructions will be provided on this site as to how you should submit your work. These instructions can be found under **Deliverables** in each assignment/project.

## Late Work

Late work will not be accepted. Exceptions will be granted if the student initiates a conversation (e.g. in-person or email) and provides a reasonable explanation for why the work was late (e.g. illness or extenuating circumstances). It is your responsibility to talk to me about the missing work. **Failure to talk with me via email or in-person will result in an 0 for that week's standards-based grading** (see [Grading](#grading) above).

## Academic Integrity

All work submitted should be your own unless otherwise indicated and properly credited (ie. using a library). Submitting work under another person's GitHub account or copying their code is considered cheating. Any reference material may be utilized, but copying and pasting code rarely works as intended.

# Attendance

You are expected to be in class. You are responsible for arranging make-up work with me. All make-up work from a grading period must be made up within one week of the end of that grading period. Additional time for extenuating medical issues can be arranged. If being absent causes you to miss a deadline, then you will need to follow the instructions in [Late Work](#late-work).

Please refer to the [Kingsport City Schools Attendance Policy](https://www.k12k.com/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=345735&type=d&pREC_ID=753927). Missing more than 9 unexcused absences to any one class in a semester will result in the loss of privilege to participate in Prom, Field Trips, and the Graduation Ceremony. 

# Acceptable Use Policy

The use of the internet and lab computers is a privilege, not a right. Failure to abide by school policy will result in loss of access. Refer to the Internet and Computer Use section in the Student Handbook.

Our computers are:
- Not for playing games
- Not for accessing inappropriate content
- Not for listening to music or non-curricular videos
