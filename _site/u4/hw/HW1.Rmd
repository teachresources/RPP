```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# Step1: Open RStudio

# Step 2: Install swirl
Type the following into the console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("swirl")
```

# Step 3: Start swirl
This is the only step that you will repeat every time you want to run swirl. First, you will load the package using the ```library()``` function. Then you will call the function that starts the magic! 

Type the following, pressing Enter after each line:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library("swirl")
install_course("R Programming")
```

If it does not work, you can install manually:

* Download [this](http://swirlstats.com/scn/R_Programming.swc) file. 
* Save this file on your RPP Directory:
* Select the file you just downloaded: *R_Programming.swc*.
Run:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
swirl::install_course() 
```

# Step4: Have fun!


```{r, eval=FALSE}
swirl()
```
