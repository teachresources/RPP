# Challenge Project

Students will use all the code and concepts learned and practice during all the sessions of this class to perform the statistical analysis of their current thesis data or another chosen project data. The results of the Challenge Project will be presented by each student during the last week of the course (see presentation Template [here](https://teachresources.github.io/RPP/projects/project_slides.zip)). In addition, each student will write a detailed analysis report of the project analysis. This report needs to include all analysis steps and conclusions. The final project reports should be written in R Markdown. Both the R Markdown script (.Rmd) along with the rendered HTML or PDF report will be submitted to each studentâ€™s private GitHub repository. The expected structure of the final project report is outlined below.
